### Calculation Example

Let's have a product with the following scenario:

You have a product that you acquired for $15. Following your marketing efforts, you managed to secure 50 leads (orders) at a cost of $1 per lead. The fulfillment center successfully confirmed 40 orders but only delivered to 30 customers. The fees for confirmation were $1 each, and shipping cost $30 per delivery.

If you sell this product for $60, your total profit would amount to $360.
